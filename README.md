# React Portfolio template with framer motion and dark mode 

## Features
- Customisable color Pallete.
- Light and dark mode.
- Framer Motion Animations.
- Completely Responsive

### prerequisites

- have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your computer.
- Basic understanding of git (you can just watch a quick tutorial on how to fork and clone a repository)
- have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your machine.
- basic understanding of JSON data outline (arrays of objects basically).

## how to use

- fork the repository and clone locally.
- cd into the project folder and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
- run `npm run dev` to start a local copy of the project. (I've used vite)
- run `npm run build` to build the project for deployment

## Instructions
#### Images
- replace the images in the public folder 
- DO NOT CHANGE THE NAMES FOR Heroimg.png and icon.png, when you update thrm give your images exactly these names so they replace mine, also make sure both of these are in png format.
- Hero section image would look a lot better with the background removed, you can use https://remove.bg to remove background from your image.
- The mock1, mock2 etc. images are used in the projects section, there are instructions on how to update them in Data.jsx file so just follow those.

#### Your Information
- Go to Data.jsx and follow the instructions there to replace all data with your own personal information.

#### Color Scheme
- All the colors in the website are dynamic and accessed through Theme.jsx file, and have been differentiated by dark and loght mode.
- Pls don't change the property names of the colors, only the values.

And you're done! <br>
If you save the file and check your live server, you should see that the information has been updated and
the portfolio has been customized. <br>
Now, you can commit and push your changes to your forked repository, and deploy your portfolio. <br>

If you have any questions or issues with the setup process, feel free to contact me by any of the means below: <br>

Please credit me for the template. If u want to remove the link in the footer, that's completely fine(its's in footer.jsx), but pls add the link to my github in your readme or wherever you'd like!
